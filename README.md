**SQL Learning Journey: From Zero to Intermediate**
Welcome to my SQL learning journey! This document highlights the key concepts and skills I have developed while progressing from a beginner to an intermediate level in SQL.
**Learning Objectives**
**Throughout this journey, I have focused on mastering various SQL techniques and concepts, including:**

**ETL Fundamentals:** Understanding the principles of Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) processes to handle data integration and transformation.
**Data Warehousing:** Exploring data warehousing concepts and practices for efficient data storage and retrieval.
**OLAP and OLTP:** Differentiating between Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) and Online Transaction Processing (OLTP) to apply appropriate data handling methods.
**Subqueries:** Learning to embed queries within other queries for advanced data filtering and manipulation.
**Common Table Expressions (CTEs):** Utilizing CTEs to simplify complex queries and improve readability, especially in recursive queries.
**Temporary Tables:** Applying temporary tables for managing intermediate data during complex operations.
**Joining Tables:** Mastering various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to combine and analyze data from multiple sources.
**User-Defined Functions:**Creating and using user-defined functions to encapsulate reusable logic and calculations.
**Stored Procedures:** Developing stored procedures to automate repetitive tasks and encapsulate complex SQL code.
**Code Reusability:** Organizing and storing SQL code for efficiency and reusability in different projects.

**Key Concepts and Techniques**

**ETL Fundamentals:** Applied principles to integrate and transform data from diverse sources, enhancing data quality and accessibility.
**Data Warehousing:** Implemented techniques for structuring and querying large datasets, supporting efficient data retrieval and analysis.
**OLAP vs. OLTP:** Employed appropriate processing models based on the data nature and query requirements, optimizing performance and functionality.
**Subqueries:** Utilized nested queries to perform operations on data subsets, achieving sophisticated data filtering and aggregation.
**CTEs:** Simplified complex queries and improved readability by using Common Table Expressions for temporary result sets.
**Temporary Tables:** Managed intermediate results in complex operations, streamlining query execution and logic.
**Joining Tables:** Combined data from multiple tables using various joins to generate comprehensive reports and analyses.
**User-Defined Functions:** Developed custom functions for specific data processing tasks, enhancing code modularity and reuse.
**Stored Procedures:** Encapsulated complex SQL logic and automated tasks through stored procedures, improving efficiency and consistency.
**Code Reusability:** Focused on writing modular SQL code for reusability, facilitating easier maintenance and development.

**Conclusion**
This journey has provided a robust foundation in SQL, empowering me to handle diverse data manipulation and analysis tasks with increasing complexity. I am eager to continue building on these skills and exploring advanced SQL techniques in future projects.
